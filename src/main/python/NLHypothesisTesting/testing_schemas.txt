Null:               There is no more than autocorrelated linear structure in the data.
Assumption:         Data generated from n independent gaussian distributions.
Surrogates:         For every entry x_t in the data,  swap x_t with a randomly selected x_t* such that  t mod n = t* mod n
Quality check:      Compare autocorrelation plots of surrogates to data and see if structure is maintained.
If:                 Linear structure is maintained upon shuffling as indicated by the acf plots AND SMaps is
                    significantly better than surrogates,
Then:  	            Decreased performance of shuffled datasets may be due to loss of nonlinear 	structure. What
                    predictability is left is possibly due to linear autocorrelated structure.

Null:               There is no more than linear stochastic structure in the data. (I.e. we can do no better than
                    the optimal AR model)
Assumption:         Data generated from a linear stochastic process with gaussian inputs.
Surrogates:    	    Ebisuzuki shuffles
Quality check:      Compare power spectrum of data
If:                 SMaps is significantly better than surrogates
Then:               Decreased performance of shuffled datasets may be due to loss of nonlinear structure. What
                    predictability is left is possibly due to linear stochastic structure.
