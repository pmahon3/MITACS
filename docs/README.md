## Ontario Power Demand

Ontario's power grid is managed by the [Independent Energy System Operator (IESO)](https://www.ieso.ca/) of Ontario. Historical data is aquired from the [IESO database](http://reports.ieso.ca/public/). Weather and climate data is aquired from the [Government of Canada](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html) and the [NASA Power Project](https://power.larc.nasa.gov).

## State Space Reconstruction Methods and Empirical Dynamic Modelling

[Empirical Dynamic Modelling](https://deepeco.ucsd.edu/nonlinear-dynamics-research/edm/) is a set of state space reconstruction based methods for non-linear data analysis built upon [Takens' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takens%27s_theorem). This project uses Empirical Dynamic Modelling packages ([pyEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/pyEDM), [rEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/rEDM)) to analyze Ontario power grid dynamics, specifically  a statistical test for directional causality in non-linear time series called [convergent cross mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_cross_mapping). Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrFdIz-D2yM&ab_channel=SugiharaLab).
