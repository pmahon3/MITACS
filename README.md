## Ontario Power Demand

Ontario's power grid is managed by the [Independent Energy System Operator (IESO)](https://www.ieso.ca/) of Ontario. Historical data is aquired from IESO database [here](http://reports.ieso.ca/public/).

## State Space Reconstruction Methods and Empirical Dynamic Modelling

[Empirical Dynamic Modelling](https://deepeco.ucsd.edu/nonlinear-dynamics-research/edm/]) is a set of state space reconstruction based methods for non-linear data analysis built upon [Takens' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takens%27s_theorem). This project using Empirical Dynamic Modelling packages ([pyEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/pyEDM), [rEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/rEDM)) to analyze Ontario power grid demand.
